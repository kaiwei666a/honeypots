### Analysis of Attack Pattern

The logs indicate a successful SSH brute force attack originating from the local IP address `127.0.0.1`. The attacker was denied access initially but granted access upon entering the credentials `user` and `asd`. Once authenticated, the attacker established a shell session and executed the `ls` command, potentially to enumerate the directory contents. The presence of an SSH connection from `127.0.0.1` suggests possible use of a proxy or compromised local service.

### Identification of Vulnerabilities

1. Weak or Default Credentials: The attacker successfully used simple credentials, indicating a lack of strong password policies.
2. Unrestricted SSH Access: The SSH service is accepting connections from all sources, including localhost, without restriction on brute force attempts.
3. Lack of Intrusion Detection: There is no evidence from the logs of intrusion detection systems (IDS) responding to the brute force attempts.

### Actionable Defense Strategies

#### Step 1: Enforce Stronger Authentication

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Configure SSH to use public key authentication and require an additional layer, such as OTP or hardware tokens.
   
2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
   - Update the password policy to require a minimum length of 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
   - Implement a password history policy to prevent reuse of past passwords.
   
#### Step 2: Restrict SSH Access

1. **Limit SSH Access to Specific IPs:**
   - Modify `sshd_config` to allow connections only from trusted IP addresses:
     ```
     /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
     AllowUsers user@trusted_IP
     ```

2. **Use Fail2ban to Mitigate Brute Force Attacks:**
   - Install and configure Fail2ban to monitor SSH logs and temporarily ban IPs after a predefined number of failed attempts:
     ```
     [sshd]
     enabled = true
     maxretry = 3
     bantime = 3600
     ```

#### Step 3: Deploy an Intrusion Detection System

1. **Integrated IDS (such as Snort or Suricata):**
   - Deploy an IDS to detect and alert on suspicious activities such as brute force attacks and unexpected user commands.
   - Configure specific rules to track failed and successful login attempts to SSH and take preemptive actions as needed.

#### Step 4: Regularly Update and Patch Systems

1. **Automate System Updates:**
   - Use automation tools like Ansible or scripts to apply security patches to all systems regularly.

#### Step 5: Monitor and Audit Security Logs

1. **Centralize Logs with a SIEM System:**
   - Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to aggregate and analyze logs from various sources for real-time threat detection.

2. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct regular security audits, including vulnerability scans, to ensure compliance with security policies and detect potential weaknesses.

#### Step 6: Configure Additional Honeypot Layers

1. **Set up Honeypot Alerts:**
   - Configure your honeypot to immediately notify the security team upon executing specific commands like `ls` to detect initial enumeration efforts.

### Conclusion

Implementing this defense strategy by enhancing SSH access security, deploying detection systems, and ensuring systems are up-to-date will significantly mitigate the risk of a similar attack. By enforcing these measures, an organization will be better equipped to detect and respond rapidly to potential breaches, ensuring stronger protection against unauthorized intrusions.
