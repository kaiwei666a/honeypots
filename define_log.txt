## Detailed Security Plan to Counter Detected Threat

### Analysis of Attack Pattern

- **Unauthorized SSH Access:** The attack logs show an SSH connection initiated from IP `172.18.0.1`.
- **Credential Theft:** The attacker successfully logged in using a username (`user`) and password (`kasld`), indicating potentially weak or compromised credentials.
- **Command Execution:** The attacker executed the `ls` command after gaining shell access.
  
### Identified Vulnerabilities

1. **Weak SSH Credentials:** The attacker was able to authenticate using a password, suggesting weak or reused credentials.
2. **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** No evidence of multi-factor authentication being employed.
3. **Insufficient Brute Force Protection:** Rapid attempts with different credentials suggest weak brute-force protection.

### Actionable Defense Strategies

#### Step 1: Strengthen Authentication Mechanisms

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication:**

   - **Action:** Configure SSH to require MFA for all users.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator
     ```
   - **SSH Configuration:**
     Add the following to `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:
     ```plaintext
     auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
     ```
     Update `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
     ```plaintext
     ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
     ```
   - **Restart SSH Service:**
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart sshd
     ```

2. **Enhance Password Policies:**

   - **Action:** Enforce strong password policies.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
     ```
     Add or update:
     ```plaintext
     password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=12 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1
     ```

#### Step 2: Deploy Access Controls and Monitoring

1. **Restrict SSH Access:**

   - **Action:** Limit SSH access to trusted IP addresses.
   - **Firewall Rule:**
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 22
     sudo ufw deny 22
     ```

2. **Configure SSH Rate Limiting:**

   - **Action:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
   - **Netfilter Rule:**
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 -j DROP
     ```

3. **Implement Intrusion Detection:**

   - **Action:** Use Fail2Ban to monitor and block suspicious activities.
   - **Installation and Configuration:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install fail2ban
     sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
     ```
     Add or update:
     ```plaintext
     [sshd]
     enabled = true
     maxretry = 3
     bantime = 3600
     findtime = 600
     ```

#### Step 3: System Hardening and Monitoring

1. **Periodic Security Audits:**

   - **Action:** Use monitoring tools to audit SSH logs regularly.
   - **Tool:** Use tools such as `Lynis` for system auditing.
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install lynis
     sudo lynis audit system
     ```

2. **Honeypot Simulation Enhancements:**

   - Ensure honeypot interaction is logged and analyzed in real-time.
   - Deploy additional decoy services to detect lateral movement beyond SSH.

### Conclusion
By implementing these specific and actionable measures, you significantly strengthen your system's defenses against unauthorized SSH access and potential intrusions. Ensure that all steps are applied cautiously, and continually monitor system logs for any unusual activities. These measures align with industry best practices and enhance both proactive and reactive security postures.
