# Security Plan to Mitigate Detected Mirai Download Attempt

## Analysis of Attack Pattern
**Observed Activity:** The attacker executed a command to download a file named `mirai` from localhost, suggesting a download attempt potentially tied to the Mirai botnet, known for targeting IoT devices to build a network of bots used for DDoS attacks.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
1. **Exposed Localhost Web Services**: The use of `localhost` implies services running locally that should not be accessible or that the attacker is operating locally on the compromised machine.
2. **Insufficient File Integrity and Execution Restrictions**: The systems lack restrictions on file downloads and script execution that could easily prevent successful exploits.

## Immediate Defense Strategy

### Step 1: Prevent Unauthorized Downloads
- **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure outbound connections from the attacked system to unknown IPs (potential C2 servers) are restricted.
  - **Rule**: Disable HTTP (`port 80`) and HTTPS (`port 443`) traffic to all hosts unless explicitly permitted.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw deny out 80
    sudo ufw deny out 443
    ```

### Step 2: Strengthen Permission Settings
- **Directory and File Permission Audit**: Ensure that critical directories do not have overly permissive access rights.
  - **Command**:
    ```bash
    chmod -R go-rwx /path/to/sensitive/data
    ```
  - Review ownership and permissions of critical binaries and folders to ensure they're not writable by ordinary users.

### Step 3: Enhance Network Monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Configuration**: Deploy or adjust IDS rules to detect and alert on suspicious commands like those involving `wget` from local resources.
  - **Example Snort Rule**:
    ```
    alert tcp any any -> 127.0.0.1 any (msg:"LOCAL HOST PAYLOAD"; content:"wget"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
    ```

### Step 4: System Hardening
- **Disable Unnecessary Services**: Evaluate all running services and disable ones that aren't necessary, especially those allowing remote or unwarranted local access.
  - **Commands**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop [service_name]
    sudo systemctl disable [service_name]
    ```

- **Script Execution Controls**: Implement restrictions on the execution of scripts and untrusted binaries.
  - Introduce NoExec flags on `/tmp` and sticky bits.
  - **Commands**:
    ```bash
    sudo mount -o remount,noexec /tmp
    chmod +t /tmp
    ```

### Step 5: Implement Logging and Alerts
- Set up logging for all file downloads and execution attempts to `/tmp`.
  - **Configuration**: Ensure syslogs capture execution of commands like `wget`, and someone reviews these logs regularly.
  - **Quick Setup via auditd**:
    ```bash
    sudo auditctl -w /usr/bin/wget -p x -k file_operations
    ```

### Step 6: User Awareness and Education
- Educate users about the importance of not running unauthorized scripts or programs.
- Initiate security awareness training sessions focusing on social engineering and phishing, common avenues for botnet deployment.

## Rolling Updates and Monitoring
- **Regular Patch Management**: Ensure the system is updated with the latest security patches.
- **Frequent Review**: Schedule regular audits of network configuration, logs, and permissions.

This structured approach, based on industry best practices, addresses the immediate risk while steadily hardening the system against potential exploits related to the Mirai-related attack vector identified. Follow-up actions should ensure continuous adaptation to new threats as they are discovered.
