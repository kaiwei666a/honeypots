Generate a Python-based ActiveMQ Honeypot that can:

Simulate an ActiveMQ Web Console (Port 8161)

Create a Flask web server with:
    / endpoint returning "ActiveMQ Web Console (Simulated)".
    /admin endpoint returning "ActiveMQ Admin Panel (Simulated)".
Monitor OpenWire Port 61616

Listen for incoming connections on port 61616 (ActiveMQ OpenWire default).
Log all connection attempts, including IP addresses and ports.
Capture incoming data and check if it contains "poc.xml".

<response>Fake XML Response</response>
Log all suspicious activity to a file named activemq_honeypot.log.
Implementation Requirements

Use Flask to simulate the web console (port 8161).
Use Python's socket module to listen on OpenWire port 61616.
Run both Flask and socket server using multithreading.
Implement proper logging to record attack attempts.
